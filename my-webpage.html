        <p>Monaco is the second smallest nation in the world (after Holy See),
            and the second most densely populated. Located in Europe,
            it is divided into 10 wards.
            The tiny territory of Monaco has a history dating as far back as 400,000 BC.
            Evidence found in a cave in St. Judist’s Gardens confirms that early humans 
            took shelter in this land that long ago. Based on the accounts of Greek historians
            Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, it is believed that the country’s first permanent 
            settlers were a bunch of mountain-dwelling emigrants from 
            Genoa, Italy, known as the Ligures.
            The total population of Monaco is nearly 40,000, which, of course, won’t seem like much at first glance.
            But for a country whose total area is below one square mile, that’s a whole lot of people. In fact,
            there’s no other country in the world that has a higher population density than this microstate. However,
            there are more than two dozen cities in different parts of the world that have an area above one square mile
            and over 50,000 residing per square mile. So, Monaco definitely isn’t the most crowded place you’ll find.
            The national flag of Monaco consists of two equal horizontal bands, with the top band being red and
            the bottom one being white. 
            The flag’s design has remained unchanged since 1881, before which, it bore an older version of the country’s coat of arms.
