                 <p>Monaco is the second smallest nation in the world (after Holy See),
                    and the second most densely populated. Located in Europe,
                    it is divided into 10 wards.
                    The tiny territory of Monaco has a history dating as far back as 400,000 BC.
                    Evidence found in a cave in St. Judist’s Gardens confirms that early humans 
                    took shelter in this land that long ago. Based on the accounts of Greek historians
                    Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, it is believed that the country’s first permanent 
                    settlers were a bunch of mountain-dwelling emigrants from 
                    Genoa, Italy, known as the Ligures.
                    The total population of Monaco is nearly 40,000, which, of course, won’t seem like much at first glance.
                    But for a country whose total area is below one square mile, that’s a whole lot of people. In fact,
                    there’s no other country in the world that has a higher population density than this microstate. However,
                    there are more than two dozen cities in different parts of the world that have an area above one square mile
                    and over 50,000 residing per square mile.
                    Monaco is a country where you don’t have to pay any income taxes, and the business taxes too are incredibly low.
                     Hence, plenty of rich and super-rich people from across the globe have immigrated to this tax haven.
                      As a result, millionaires make up 32.1 percent of the country’s population today, a fun fact about Monaco. 
                    Needless to say, that’s way more than the percentage of millionaires that any other country has.
